    <p class="card-text">The Hungry Spectator was developed by four tech savy developers who constantly found themselves surronded by the mouth watering smells of food. Wheather out at a concert or sporting event they always wondered what was good to eat in the area. It was from this wonder that The Hungry Spectator was born. </p>

In addition, I have also received a Bachelors of Arts from Roosevelt University in Political Science and Philosopy and a Bachalors of Science in Technical Management from DeVry University.</p>

                     <p>Outside of work, I can be found goofing off with my husband and son, going to concerts, playing with my beagle pup Lucy, reading whatever the new hot book is and in the warmer months attempting to train to run in some long road race which will ultimately make me question why I do this to myself. When the seasons turn colder I can be found wishing I had the skills of a Canadian while playing the ice sport of curling. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">In a galaxy far, far away I was a high school math teacher(not far at all actually). I stumbled upon a galaxy known as Northwestern University. In this galaxy, I have chosen to learn about the force within Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. All jokes aside, I was born in Tamuning, Guam in April of 1992. I moved to Chicago in the cold winter of 1996. I graduated with a BS in Mathematics at Dominican University in the spring of 2014 and a 6-12 teaching certificate in the spring of 2015.</p>

                    <p>In my free time I enjoy working out, learning more about coding, watching movies and television shows, hanging out with friends and family, reading, and eating delicious food. I LOVE BASKETBALL! I like to occasionally shoot hoops and break ankles of my local community.</p>

I want to be at place where my voice can be heard, people are passionate and enthusiastic about their work, and ready to help you out when you are stuck. I come from a Computer Science background and I have 3 years of experience working in Core Java. I am enrolled in a  Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Northwestern University and looking for opportunities to build robust applications with a fast-paced growing company. I prefer working with a small team (8 to 10 developers) in an office environment.  I would like to work under a leader who believes in creating leaders rather than followers.</p>
